### **Usage**
1. Enter the recipient's phone number and your message in the form. If you are using a Twilio free trial account, there are specific restrictions and requirements to be aware of:
- You can only send SMS messages to phone numbers that are verified as Caller IDs in your Twilio account.
- Verification involves receiving a one-time passcode (OTP) on the desired number, which must be validated in your Twilio account settings.
- Twilioâ€™s Verified Caller ID service is only available for the US1 data routing region at this time.
2. Click "Send SMS."
3. View the status and details of the message on the response page.
